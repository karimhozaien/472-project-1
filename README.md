## Description
This project implements a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits using logistic regression. The dataset used is `load_digits` from `sklearn.datasets`, which contains 8x8 grayscale images of digits (0â€“9).

The model is trained on normalized pixel data and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Numpy is used for data exploration and analysis.


## Features
- Data normalization using Numpy
- Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report


## How to Run
